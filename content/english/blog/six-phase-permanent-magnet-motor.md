Multiphase machines are drawing more and more attention in Electric Vehicle industry. The potential advantages of multiphase machines, in comparison with three-phase machines, include: reduced torque pulsation, reduced harmonic content of the DC link current, improved stator magnetomotive force (MMF) waveform, improved efficiency, and reduced per phase current rating. In addition, reliability is greatly improved since the machine can continue to operate even if one or several phases are lost.

#Multiphase machines are drawing more and more attention in Electric Vehicle (#EV) industry. The potential advantages of #multiphase machines, in comparison with three-phase machines, include: reduced torque pulsation, reduced #harmonic  content of the DC link current, improved stator magnetomotive force  (MMF) waveform, improved efficiency, and reduced per phase current  rating. In addition, #reliability is greatly improved since the machine can continue to operate even if one or (in some cases) several phases are lost. 

Main representative of #multiphase motors is the #six-phase #motor, which got more and more popular in the last few years.

Main draw-back at such a motor is its modelling and control difficulty. We at BWS e-Mobility Technologies GmbH are working on different modelling approaches (#VSD , Double #DQ) for better understanding of #six_phase motors and also their controls including #MTPA and #Field_Weakening Algorithms. With our Six-Phase #Simulink Toolbox you will be able to #model and #control six-phase motors with configurable control scheme and with different spatial shifts angles.
