SYSTEMY is created to be used by a  wide spectrum of users, which depending on their demands can use the  different features and functionalities of the tool. In following we will  roughly summarize the types of users according to their demands: 

1. Big OEM: for this user categorypresents  a very useful tool enabling them to quick design and adapt their new  model line vehicles which share the majority of power train components  with other model lines, in this case OEMs can feed the corresponding  specification of the already existing component into the database ofallowing it to consider those component for the calculation and optimization of the new power train or drive line.     

2. Medium-Size OEM and Start-Ups: this category of users can mostly effective use the design tool SYSTEMY:  for such enterprises it is very important to enter the market with  minimal cost, less effort and so quick, that means they must use/bey the  existing components because they don't have either the budget nor the  time to develop new components, in this case, SYSTEMY can  enormously support them to reach their goals very quick and effective.  It will support them not only by designing their electric power train,  but also will provide them with a huge database including all existing  components needed for the power train design     

3. System Suppliers: System  suppliers usually don't have or develop all components of the power  train themself, often they integrate third-party components in their  power train system, in this case SYSTEMY will present a powerful  tool enabling them to find the optimized components of the design and  optimize the whole system including the own component for the  multi-objectives defined by the client     

4. Powertrain Component Manufacturers:for  component developer it is very important to have a feeling about the  goodness and the suitability of the to be developed component and to  benchmarking it. SYSTEMY enables you in this case to compare  designs using your component with other ones using already established  components and hence showing you in advance how effective, reliable,  competitive and expensive your component is. This will support you by  developing the right component for the right price and with the  appropriate quantity. 

5. Vehicle Converting Companies:for  those companies, who are specialized on converting the power train of  already existing vehicle (i.e. fleet vehicles) from internal consumption  engines to electric power train, SYSTEMY is a very useful tool  as for such a company it is very important to get their power train  converted without deep diving in details of the technology. Hereby SYSTEMY will  offer them the whole needed tool chain starting with design ending with  component selection, optimization and system conducting.   Do you have you special demands which are not covered above? Please  contact us, we can together custom your needs and make them reality!
